// Local HTTP proxy sitting between mpv and the remote stream.
//
// This used to be a pure pass-through: every Range request from mpv was
// forwarded upstream verbatim, and the moment mpv closed its connection the
// upstream reply was aborted and whatever had already been downloaded was
// thrown away.
//
// That breaks sources whose audio track is stored apart from the video
// (non-interleaved layout, common for WEB-DL MP4). libavformat then asks for
// the audio in tiny chunks that alternate with the video, so every chunk costs
// a full round trip; when a round trip takes ~1.75s and one chunk only carries
// ~0.1s of audio, playback starves no matter how large the mpv buffers are.
//
// The relay now keeps a byte-range cache between mpv and upstream:
//   * upstream reads are shared by every mpv connection and keyed by absolute
//     file offset, so a read starting at X can serve any later request that
//     falls inside [X, X + readahead);
//   * when mpv disconnects mid-stream the upstream read is NOT aborted -- it
//     keeps going up to its limit and feeds the cache ("finish the read").
//     The next request for a nearby offset is answered from memory in
//     microseconds instead of paying another round trip.
